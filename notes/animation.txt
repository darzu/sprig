Robolox style, standard "knight" animations:
    Run, Walk, Jump, Idle, Fall, Swim, Climb
    supports multiple animations per category, indicating (weighted) variation

Skinned vs not:
    Skinned introduces new vertices (I think)
        Mixamo introduces lots of new triangles

TO LEARN:

Rigid animation:
    Seperate meshes, childed, placed with offsets
        Also works well for body animations like a rock golum
    Single vertex buffer, just stretched

Animation groups:
    Biped (human, mech)
    Quadraped (dog, cat)

How import are animations?
    Meta: effort should be spent proportial to gameplay

Two frame animations:
    Sword slash: wind up, strike
    Walking, running: walk left, walk right

    sort of arcade fighting style

    Effects:
        Tween vertices?
        glow trails between keyframes?
            allow user to draw trail?
            let the user chose: straight path, orbit path, ???
