Robolox style, standard "knight" animations:
    Run, Walk, Jump, Idle, Fall, Swim, Climb
    supports multiple animations per category, indicating (weighted) variation

Skinned vs not:
    Skinned introduces new vertices (I think)
        Mixamo introduces lots of new triangles

TO LEARN:

Rigid animation:
    Seperate meshes, childed, placed with offsets
        Also works well for body animations like a rock golum
    Single vertex buffer, just stretched

Animation Bootcamp: An Indie Approach to Procedural Animation    
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNidsMesxSE
    "Do No Harm" to the gameplay
        start with physics first
    If your consistent, players will say "intuitive" and "responsive"
        interactive means u can interrupt any animation at any time
    Better to start with mapping gamepad straight to acceleration
    Acceleration tilt does A LOT
    2 frame animation wheel
        pass pose, reach pose
        match stride to ground
    then another 2 frames for walking speed
    then synchronize blend between walking and running
    bounce: bounce more the slower, less the faster 
        "b/c gravity is always constant" -> "if you only have have as long in the stride, u fall half as far"
    interpolate between key frames
        bicubic interp is better than linear (less jerky?)
        spacial and velocity continuity
    added a crouch frame "needed some squash"
        lerp still isn't good, so used spring
    added sync for crouch walking
    2 more frames: jumping, w/ crouching spring
    1 more frame: ball, for flipping in the air
    2 more frames: rolling, tuck pose forward, tuck pose to the side
    movement: 13 key frames
        nice thing about so few: easy to add variation
            e.g. variation where he's carying a spear
    refinement:
        inverse kinimatics, move joints a little based on terrain ?
            no library, just a little trig
    1 key frame for grabbing a ledge,
        inverse kinimatics for smoothing nicely 
    refinement:
        look targets, moving head to track object
        or moving torso to face enemy
    refinement: secondary physics, 
        e.g. cape, scabard, or ears
        softness parameter for each bone,
            so arms are little wobly
    profiling: try different things until you find stuff that looks bad
        e.g. jumping straight into a wall looked pretty dumb,
            so changed that into a wall run and now it looks awesome
    rag dolls:
        originally box, eventually articulated
        tried: adding delay, clutching limbs before falling
        active ragdolls: limbs sorta try to do things before they fall
        tried: 
            pose matching, try to maintain pose (joint constraints)
            animation matching, try to keep walking e.g.
        animation tree:
            far from surface, flail
            close to surface, curl up
    all these animation tricks work in first person or other animation contexts
        spring for tweening
        recoil spring
    identify repeat animation tasks, extract them out as curves
    instead of using IK to hold a ball, just use 2 frames: very large ball, very small ball and interpolate

    tree heirarchy of bones
      ea bone has a "model matrix", transformation of bone relative to model origin
        + need inverse model matrix
      ea bone has a local matrix, transformation of bone relative to parent
    each vertex painted with bone influence
      4 bone indices
      4 bone weights (all weights must sum to 1)
    for animation,
      need model animation after

Rigging in blender for good glTF export:
  - build mesh however. at the end, combine everything into one object (Cmd-J)
  - build amature and name the bones
  - In object mode, select mesh, then armature
  - Ctrl-P -> Empty vertex groups
  - Add vertexes to each group by logical bone name
    - for low-poly, manually editing vertex groups is easy
  - when exporting, set "Animation > Always sample animations" to false
    - we want the keyframes, and will tween them ourselves
  - If backface culling is removing triangles, select all faces in edit mode and do "Mesh>Normals>Recalculate Outside"
  - When in doubt, always apply all transforms (Command-A, All transforms) to both the object and the armature!
