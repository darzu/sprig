Hosted servers
    e.g. Roblox, heroiclabs

consulting

ideally: so cheap it doesn't need funding
    peer-to-peer only
    all file hosting is elsewhere
    static content only, CDN served

Less ideal:
    cut per game > $xxk/yer (e.g. Unity for >100k/yr)
    pay to remove splash screen

never:
    ads

  Time estimates:
    most important way to avoid burnout
    track aggressively, annotate as much as possible
    stick to that data
  "If you're not growing, you are shrinking"
    That's just not true

Funding update for Patreons:
  patreon is the best form, would like to continue and grow
    growing it realistically involves a constant feed of articles and youtube videos
      eventually this is absolutely the goal, but right now I believe the right
      focus is on the tech platform which is much harder to make good vids about
      without lots of effort in editting and story telling
  so trying out selling games
    fits all of our goals neatly
      proves the platform, provides credibility
      the real test case to iron out API and tech decisions on the way to 1.0 (i.e. backward compatibility)
    might be closed source at first, hopefully for a short window of time
    ideally even games w/ a price tag would be premissively open sourced,
      but this is basically never done in the industry and while i think it's possible
      it's also a risk factor. And there are already plenty of risk factors to selling
      a game so we might de-risk things by having the game initially be closed-source.
    All closed source games released by sprigland studios would eventually be open-source,
      probably fully permissive (MIT or CC)
  patreon future:
    geared around supporting learning content, tools and open sourced games
    eventually I want to get near daily streams of building games in Sprigland going (like MakeCode livestream)
      but also edit these down to more watchable YT and TikToks
    want accompanying interactive tutorial articles for many of these as well
    patreon model fits well here
  if patreons think they've been mislead in any way, happy to refund their contribution.
