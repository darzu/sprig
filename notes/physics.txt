Rapier on it's broad phase:
https://github.com/dimforge/rapier/blob/master/src/geometry/broad_phase_multi_sap/broad_phase.rs
    /// A broad-phase combining a Hierarchical Grid and Sweep-and-Prune.
    ///
    /// The basic Sweep-and-Prune (SAP) algorithm has one significant flaws:
    /// the interactions between far-away objects. This means that objects
    /// that are very far away will still have some of their endpoints swapped
    /// within the SAP data-structure. This results in poor scaling because this
    /// results in lots of swapping between endpoints of AABBs that won't ever
    /// actually interact.
    ///
    /// The first optimization to address this problem is to use the Multi-SAP
    /// method. This basically combines an SAP with a grid. The grid subdivides
    /// the spaces into equally-sized subspaces (grid cells). Each subspace, which we call
    /// a "region" contains an SAP instance (i.e. there SAP axes responsible for
    /// collecting endpoints and swapping them when they move to detect interaction pairs).
    /// Each AABB is inserted in all the regions it intersects.
    /// This prevents the far-away problem because two objects that are far away will
    /// be located on different regions. So their endpoints will never meed.
    ///
    /// However, the Multi-SAP approach has one notable problem: the region size must
    /// be chosen wisely. It could be user-defined, but that's makes it more difficult
    /// to use (for the end-user). Or it can be given a fixed value. Using a fixed
    /// value may result in large objects intersecting lots of regions, resulting in
    /// poor performances and very high memory usage.
    ///
    /// So a solution to that large-objects problem is the Multi-SAP approach is to
    /// replace the grid by a hierarchical grid. A hierarchical grid is composed of
    /// several layers. And each layer have different region sizes. For example all
    /// the regions on layer 0 will have the size 1x1x1. All the regions on the layer
    /// 1 will have the size 10x10x10, etc. That way, a given AABB will be inserted
    /// on the layer that has regions big enough to avoid the large-object problem.
    /// For example a 20x20x20 object will be inserted in the layer with region
    /// of size 10x10x10, resulting in only 8 regions being intersect by the AABB.
    /// (If it was inserted in the layer with regions of size 1x1x1, it would have intersected
    /// 8000 regions, which is a problem performancewise.)
    ///
    /// We call this new method the Hierarchical-SAP.
    ///
    /// Now with the Hierarchical-SAP, we can update each layer independently from one another.
    /// However, objects belonging to different layers will never be detected as intersecting that
    /// way. So we need a way to do inter-layer interference detection. There is a lot ways of doing
    /// this: performing inter-layer Multi-Box-Pruning passes is one example (but this is not what we do).
    /// In our implementation, we do the following:
    /// - The AABB bounds of each region of the layer `n` are inserted into the corresponding larger region
    ///   of the layer `n + 1`.
    /// - When an AABB in the region of the layer `n + 1` intersects the AABB corresponding to one of the
    ///   regions at the smaller layer `n`, we add that AABB to that smaller region.
    /// So in the end it means that a given AABB will be inserted into all the region it intersects at
    /// the layer `n`. And it will also be inserted into all the regions it intersects at the smaller layers
    /// (the layers `< n`), but only for the regions that already exist (so we don't have to discretize
    /// our AABB into the layers `< n`). This involves a fair amount of bookkeeping unfortunately, but
    /// this has the benefit of keep the overall complexity of the algorithm O(1) in the typical specially
    /// coherent scenario.
    ///
    /// From an implementation point-of-view, our hierarchical SAP is implemented with the following structures:
    /// - There is one `SAPLayer` per layer of the hierarchical grid.
    /// - Each `SAPLayer` contains multiple `SAPRegion` (each being a region of the grid represented by that layer).
    /// - Each `SAPRegion` contains three `SAPAxis`, representing the "classical" SAP algorithm running on this region.
    /// - Each `SAPAxis` maintains a sorted list of `SAPEndpoints` representing the endpoints of the AABBs intersecting
    ///   the bounds on the `SAPRegion` containing this `SAPAxis`.
    /// - A set of `SAPProxy` are maintained separately. It contains the AABBs of all the colliders managed by this
    ///   broad-phase, as well as the AABBs of all the regions part of this broad-phase.


Some of my own (horribly naive) ideas about collision detection:
    Idea 0: brute force, n^2. Works okayish for ~1,000 objects.
    Idea 1: octtree, recomputed every frame
        impl 1: 
            basic tree; ea level contains what is in it (id ptrs), but nothing smaller
            ea node can only collide with itself or those lower

    Idea 2:
        octree
        each object has a bitfield indicating region memberships
        for "expected steady" objects (e.g. bullets, constant moving objects)
            when velocity or acceleration change, compute expected membership changes and a counter of when to expect them
            decrement and apply these membership changes, otherwise never check for new memberships
        occassionally recenter the origin around the player

        we could reduce the amount of collision detection work needed by making each player responsible only for checking collisions
            of their objects against authority >= their player number
    Idea 3:
        octtree

            "The key is that the objects, when put the tree, have their AABB inflated in the direction of their velocity by some platform and use-case amount. When the object moves, if it doesn't travel outside of the AABB, the tree is not modified. This effectively amortizes the cost of tree updates over multiple frames."

    "Physics for Game Programmers: Understanding Constraints" by Erin Catto
    "As a Physics Programmer, it is our job to understand constraints"
    Game Graphics: shaders
    Game Physics: constraints
    Standard constraints:
        "revolute", "prysmatic"
    We create beautiful, accurate constraints but we're saddled with crappy solvers
    To solve precisely: we need cubic time and quadratic memory
    For games: we need linear time and linear memory

    Everything starts with the position constraint
    Position constraint example:
        Need position constraint,
        Need velocity constraint,
        Need to know about impulses,
            "Apply impulses to steer the box so the velocity constraint is satisfied"
    
    When we have many bodies, we need to do global constraint solving to be accurate
    But in games, we can't afford that, so we often iteratively solve the local problems
        over and over and hope they converge.
    Understanding convergance of iterative solutions:
        You have some fraction (0,1), and you multiply your error by this every iteration
            if it's small, you converge quickly
            if it's large, you converge slowly
    
    Mass ratios are often a difficult problem
        for two circles stacked, itr needed = 3 * mass_ratio + 2

    One trick: warm start the converge using the solution from the last frame
        or iterate a few times per time step and pass results to next frame

    Block solver:
        instead of being totally local or fully global, try ~4 constraints at a time
    
    We don't use acceleration constraints, because for rigid bodies, 
        collisions are instantanious and so you need an infinite force 
        to fix the acceleration.

    Velocity constraints work well with friction

    Common method for solving position errors:
        velocity steering: tweak velocity to undo unwanted overlap
            problem: you're adding kenetic energy
            problem: constraints look less solid
        pseudo-velocity: like velocity steering but it's a seperate 
            value that only exists for that time step, so there is no 
            momentum
            simpler in some ways, no time involved (?)
    
    Are position constraints better than velocity constraints?
        With cloth solvers, we work directly with position
        With character solvers: 
            you likely don't want rigid body rules
            example, character moving into a plane:
                move character to target point, then project onto the plane

    The biggest difference with 3D is rotations become a lot more complex

    acceleration constraints: almost never (never?)
    velocity constraints: force field, ...
    position constraints: character controller

Colliders & rigidbody architecture:
    colliders have:
    - shape, size info, position info, physics on/off
    - if an object has multiple physics colliders, it is essentially the same as having a union collider of all of those
        - maybe objects only have one physics collider and one of the types of physics colliders it can have is a composite (union) collider
    - in Unity, objects can have children that are automatically position relative
        - when a collider has an event, we could traverse to the parent
    
In unity:
    ea obj has a transform
    ea obj can have children objs
    ea obj can have N components

    box collider: center xyz, size xyz
    sphere collider: center xyz, radius
    mesh collider: convex yes/no,
    capsule: center xyz, radius, height, direction x-axis, y-axis, z-axis

  handles not pointers,
  multithreading,
  
prediction and physics using parametric motion:
  for some motion, namely cannon projectiles, instead of using velocity + gravity simulation every frame, I think the better thing is just to specify a parametric i.e. fn(time) function and then each frame you just calculate where it should be along that function by passing in the time since that fn started.

  This has a lot of nice properties. 
  #1 it's totally frame rate independent. The same time will always produce the same output. Unlike an iterative velocity + gravity approach where the size of the step drastically changes the path.
  #2 network prediction can be better maybe even perfect. Since you know the timestamp and the parametric function, you don't need to lerp forward along velocity or anything (which gets less accurate the bigger the step), you simply evaluate at the right time
  #3 analytic AI prediction. Enemy AI needs to be able to aim their cannon. With a parametric equation we can solve for the appropriate angle to aim and the fuzz it to change probability of hit.

  One cool thing about our system is that this is trivial for our physics to handle since it only cares about previous frame vs current frame positions, unlike a traditional physics system where being able to impart impulses is the main way they maintain constraints and they can only do that if objects are moving according to velocity + acceleration + jerk.
