Rapier.js
    Want to use Rapier.js, but it's a difficult dependency to vender since it's split into many files.
    I tried building it myself following the github workflow for macos, but get these errors:
        npm ERR! command sh -c node bin/index.js
        npm ERR! Error: Error: This platform not supported
        ...
        error: failed to download `nalgebra-macros v0.1.0`
        ...
        feature `resolver` is required
        this Cargo does not support nightly features, but if you
        switch to nightly channel you can add
        `cargo-features = ["resolver"]` to enable this feature
        ...
        ./build_typescript.sh: line 2: pkg/raw.ts: No such file or directory
        ...
        Error: Tried to set an option (inputFiles) that was not declared.
    Options:
        1. Write my own physics and/or collision detection
            Do I need advanced physics for Sprigheim?
                Yes. Falling trees
                No. Character and enemy movement
                Yes? Carts and hills
                Yes? harpoon
        2. Bite the bullet, take on NPM and a bundler
        3. Create a dummy project w/ NPM to bundle dependencies

            basically, CPU->GPU->CPU round trip for gameplay affecting phsysics is too much
            GPU is still good choice for visual-only stuff (particles)
