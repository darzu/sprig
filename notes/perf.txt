Critique of TSC:
    "Their code makes pretty heavy use of megamorphic object shapes and unnecessary 
    dynamic property accesses (both well-known JavaScript speed bumps)"

GPU memory access costs:
  https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/questions/37/what-is-the-cost-of-changing-state
    TODO: read for good GPU perf tips
  most to least expensive state changes:
    render target (~60K/s)
    program (~300K/s)
    ROP
    texture bindings (~1.5M/s)
    vertex format
    UBO bindings
    vertex bindings
    uniform updates (~10M/s)

Animometer Test
    On Mac M1, WebGPU, soft limit of ~85,000 triangle to stay at 60fps

    "renderBundles" is essential
    "dynamicOffsets" has no impact (so far)

For automatic lod'ing:
    Maybe convert to volumetric first, then use marching cubes (or square voxels) to create lower detail versions?
