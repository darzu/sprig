    "renderBundles" is essential
    "dynamicOffsets" has no impact (so far)

For automatic lod'ing:
    Maybe convert to volumetric first, then use marching cubes (or square voxels) to create lower detail versions?

JS obj polymorphism is bad:

Elements kinds in V8: https://v8.dev/blog/elements-kinds
    - SMI is fastest:
        The range for Smis on 64-bit platforms is -2^31 to 2^31-1 (2³¹≈ 2*10⁹)
        -2147483648 to 2147483647
    - Avoid reading beyond the length of the array
    - for-of, .forEach, and iterative for loop -- all on par
    - Avoid elements kind transitions
    - Prefer arrays over array-like objects
    - Avoid polymorphism
        https://v8.dev/blog/elements-kinds#avoid-polymorphism
        if a function only ever takes one element kind, it's faster
        built-ins like Array.prototype.forEach are much more efficient at this
    - Avoid creating holes

    Kinds:
         // The "fast" kind for elements that only contain SMI values. Must be first
        // to make it possible to efficiently check maps for this kind.
        PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS,
        HOLEY_SMI_ELEMENTS,

        // The "fast" kind for tagged values. Must be second to make it possible to
        // efficiently check maps for this and the PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS kind
        // together at once.
        PACKED_ELEMENTS,
        HOLEY_ELEMENTS,

        // The "fast" kind for unwrapped, non-tagged double values.
        PACKED_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS,
        HOLEY_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS,

        // The "slow" kind.
        DICTIONARY_ELEMENTS,

        // Elements kind of the "arguments" object (only in sloppy mode).
        FAST_SLOPPY_ARGUMENTS_ELEMENTS,
        SLOW_SLOPPY_ARGUMENTS_ELEMENTS,

        // For string wrapper objects ("new String('...')"), the string's characters
        // are overlaid onto a regular elements backing store.
        FAST_STRING_WRAPPER_ELEMENTS,
        SLOW_STRING_WRAPPER_ELEMENTS,

        // Fixed typed arrays.
        UINT8_ELEMENTS,

In a big world with float problems: subtact before multiply
    https://youtu.be/Ur53sJdS8rQ?t=812

vec3 on the pass-by-value?
  It's a huge PITA to have vec3's be pass-by-reference
  Can we pack 3 floats into some JS object that's pass by value?
    Maybe 2 float32s into one of JS's float 64s

  https://v8.dev/blog/bigint
  bigints are "arbitrary precision" and pass by value. 
    And you can bitwise operate on them.
    So we should be able to pack 3 float32s into a bigint.
    Unsure about perf on this, probably horendous
    bad bitwise perf when negative

    "It's hard to beat JavaScript because the VMs are amazing. If you know a few tricks, like how to let the VM know you want integer math [1], you can get performance that's not too far off from native C in many cases. If you have a JavaScript application with a few hot functions that are slow, optimizing the JavaScript usually makes more sense than reaching for WASM."
      "In my experience the place wasm really shines is in implementing custom data structures. A wasm b-tree, skip list, rope, etc seems to outperform the equivalent javascript code by many times."

  "I generally agree with the sentiment that, trig and inv-trig functions in a shader are often a code smell (or maybe an algebra smell?) and they can often be simplified and removed with some identities, etc. But there are occasional legit uses for them." @reedbeta

With GPUs and standard forward rendering,
  why isn't there more frame-to-frame re-use?
  e.g. my vertices and pixel calculations are mostly the same answer,
    why should we do all the work each frame?
  maybe vertex shader outputs could be re-used and just readjusted slightly based on camera change and moving objects

  about:tracing can be very overwhelming, and it's difficult to document because of the size and because what's in there changes when we make code changes. So the best documentation is the code itself. There might be other documentation but unfortunately I don't know where it is exactly.
