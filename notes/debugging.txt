Typescript analyzer:
    Determine changes in the DAG between components over time (commits)
    Show boundries and names around Sprig modules
    Show interfaces

Guide:
  Is there code that should be running that isn't?
  Which code? <select lines>
  <analyze callers, and dependencies on resources and systems; analyze if those
    dependencies are met and if those systems are being run>
  <analyze conditional statements>

Frusterations dealing w/ vscode debugging:
  sometimes the chrome window will load a cached version of the code
    recompiling, deleting public/ etc wont work
    u have to refresh the browser until it picks up the new version
    super frusterating.

To do a clean rebuild:
  delete public/
  make sure you "cd .." out of the public/ folder for ur serve cmd line
  git checkout -- public/ 
  ln -s ~/assets-public/ ~/sprig/public/assets
