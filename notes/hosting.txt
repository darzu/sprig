Google App Engine

K lots of free/cheap options, what r our needs?
  Want infinite version-pinned releases a la MakeCode
  Want every commit could be a released site, or one CLI push
  Want assets to be version pinned

Can we use github actions to commit to another repo?
  Then we could auto build each commit/PR and save it to some sprig_built 
  repo which would host each version.

Regarding strategies for stopping ur HTML game from being copied:
  https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/wfh1ch/our_team_has_noticed_quite_a_few_websites/
  (assuming we're not freely licensing)
  Best: JS domain locking w/ "Continue playing our game here: LINK"
    essentially make it a demo and funnel
  DCMA possible but annoying

Thought about project state syncing between computers:
  For cloud-synced project (a la Steam save state syncing or MakeCode syncing)
  Don't let an edit session start until the cloud has acknowledged that ur starting a session
  Then, warn on starting an edit session for that project elsewhere until the previous session has synced
  A little tricky for after the session is synced
  Or maybe use something more multiplayer-like
