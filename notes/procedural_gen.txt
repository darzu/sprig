Triangle grids (different from Redblob):
    https://www.boristhebrave.com/2021/05/23/triangle-grids/
    If u look at the connectivity of corners on a triangle grid, it's actually a hex grid!
    If u look at the connectivity of corners on a hex grid, it's actually a triangle grid!
    Why use triangles:
        They’re always planar
            as a height map, each vertex can be at a different heights
        They’re simple
            "triangles [are] the best shape for any algorithm that scales with the number of points or edges"
            Simplex Noise uses a triangle grid and is prefered over Perlin Noise; because of better interpolation (?)
        They have nicer geometry
            straight edges (unlike hex)
    Marching cubes (2d) on a triangle grid: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/WtfGDX
    consider making vertices "stepable":
        https://www.boristhebrave.com/2021/05/27/some-triangle-grid-extensions/
        all triangles sharing only a vertex are two steps away
        all triangles sharing an edge are one step away

No Man's Sky talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9RyEiEzMiU
    "Engines dictate design decisions"
    it's bad for progress if everybody uses someone else's engine
    every new genre was created in a new engine
    Engine veteran, wanted to write something new:
        3D terrain (caves and overhangs)
        procedurally textured
        populated with buildings, forests, creatures
        mountains several km tall
        planets millions of sqr km
        diverse planet shapes
        AI flying between planets
        untestable content
    Y is no longer up (surprisingly difficult)
    Always outside the bounds of float point
    great rant about placing a waypoint mark w/ arbitrary planets:
        https://youtu.be/C9RyEiEzMiU?t=728
    2GB download at launch
        (1.5GB was audio, 200MB UI, 300MB for all planet stuff and textures)
    "proc gen for web dev is cool area"
    noise gen (GPU) -> ploygonisation (CPU) -> Render+Physics+Population (CPU+GPU)
    wanted: surprising, playable, performant
    attempt 1: trilinear filtered low density layered perlin noise field
        like minecraft. minecraft worlds are amazing
        problem: if you don't use blocks, when everything is smooth it looks boring
    attempt 2: high density perlin noise
        post processing with feature selection, contrast, etc
        too repetative, unrealistic
        gradient is too constant, distribution of shape change isn't realistic
    attempt 3: alter noise fields using real world DEM data as trainer
        try to extract shape change data
        in the real world, feautres are exponentially distributed
        turns out, the real world is just too boring
    attempt 4: "uber noise"
        above experimentation took ~3-4 years
        common noise methods:
            perlin,
                basic noise
            simplex, 
            billow, 
                abs(perlin)
            ridged, 
                1-abs(perlin)
            worley,
            analytical derivative based alterations,
                creates realistic erosion
                have features change in relation to different octaves of noise
                knowing the slope at a point helps you distribute features much better (e.g. erosion, rivers)
            domain warping,
                feeding noise into itself
                (looks super cool!)
    "Uber Noise":
        Domain warping, slope erosion, altitude erosion, ridges, 
        plateaus, terraces, rolling hills, non-repeating features,
        analytical derivative,
        as you go between octaves, have different emphasis on different octaves


    when you're generating a single voxel, you cannot query the voxels around you
        in general you can't get that context

Loading large world, Ghost of Tsushima:

    initial estimates: ~12mb per tile, 100m tiles, 6,400 tiles
    break down goals:
        3->2.5mb terrain
        24->0mb terrain physics
        12->1mb vegitation
        0.5->0.1mb lighting
        6->3mb pathing
    new tech:
        large scale/robust editting?
        proc-gen tools
        mission tools
        optimized instance overhead?
        more data in shared core
        needed fine grain streaming??
    final disc:
        textures: 18g, mesh: 2.8g, terrain: 5.2g, streamed mesh: 0.9g, movies: 6.8g,
        cutscenes: 2.5g, music: 2.1g, dialog: 2g
        total: 56g
