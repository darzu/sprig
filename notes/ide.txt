- Bar at the bottom like MacOS or Cities Skylines
- "Edit" or "Play" button w/ small preview in top left ?
- "Download Backup" with info icon to learn about storage

Collaborative editting:
  CRDTs, OT, or good ol multiplayer net code?
  CRDTs:

Multiplayer netcode debugger:
  Have split screen open,
  paused,
  user selects two objects and says "I expected these to be the same"
  "okay, which properties?"
  "color, location"
  "looks like ColorDef is only synced and creation and LocationDef is only modified via this event <>"

entity debugger:
  pause game, enter debugger
  on hover, show which components a given entity has 
    and which systems that qualifies them for
  
Interactive min-example generating:
  start by staticly analyzing, tree shaking / program slicing everything
  run dynamic analysis on the sample scene, cut everything that isn't used
  then run in immediate compile & prune mode,
    user deletes some code, tree shaking happens again, 
    sample is run, if it's good, dynamic prune runs again
  interactive commands:
    see number of call sites for each fn
    inline a fn, then do static and dynamic prunes
  special ECS aware unroller
  maybe:
    once the sample is small enough, u can just highlight lines in VSCode and it'll
      tell you weather it'll compile and how many lines could be cut

UI proposal by Raph Levien:
  https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/gui/2022/05/07/ui-architecture.html

  inspired by SwiftUI
  also look at Elm
    "A central philosophy of Rust is that mutation isn't the problem, 
    it's shared mutable state. If you believe that philosophy (and I do), 
    then restricting yourself to pure functions over clonable state 
    feels like tying one hand behind your back."

Crowdsourced benchmarking:
  For shaders or games, in the sprig.land creations browser,
    you can ask users to submit a benchmark! they'll run the example on their
    hardware some number of iterations or benchmark and report the result
  Easier to see cross-GPU perf of everything

Code overlays:
  like a map overlay,
  have options to highlight different regions of code for different purposes like:
    error handling
    support functions / boiler plate vs. main content
    syscalls
    age
    mutative vs pure

For debugging async or init code:
  color all code by first execution order!
    or by per-frame execution order
  this will clearly show splits across an async boundry

Have a "step frame" notion

MidJourney or similiar integration for references generation?

Don't solve static and dynamic analysis in general, solve it for specific cases:
  "Developers hate annotating their code!" 
    Well, no, they hate spending time on something when they don't know the returns.
  Halting problem etc, of course these aren't solvable in general!
  But devs don't care about the general case, they care about their case.
  Don't have a single push button tool for everybody 
    (well except to the extent we can leverage special sprigland knowledge)
  Have a toolkit that allows devs to create custom code analysis for their exact game.
