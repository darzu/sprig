Coloration modes:
  Like debug colorings in a renderer (over draw, triangles, etc)
  - GPU vs CPU code,
  - ECS coloring (entities, components, systems),
  - from benchmark / dynamic trace: 
    - lines visited
    - time spent
  - library coloring (math, physics, render, etc), like MakeCode
  perhaps multiple colors: top band, center, bottom band ?

Structured editting Done Right is a big opportunity
