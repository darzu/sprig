    based on Tessendorf's "Simulating Ocean Water"
    Only needs time and parameters,
        clients and servers can simulate seperately
        infinite tiles, seamless transitions
    Downsides:
        Uses FFTs, "FFTs are expensive"
        large FFTs -> sacrafice perf
        small FFTs -> either you see patterns or not enough detail
        didn't like Phillips Spectrum
    Used 4 frequency bands
        These are just 4 tile sizes then combined ?
    Used:
        "duel fetch limited JONSWAP spectra"
            "Joint North Sea Wave Project"
        artistic control:
            wind speed, direction, fetch (?),
            spectrum peaking, directional distribution, override amplitude, low pass filter
    For buoyancy:
        Use discrete displacement samples along hull
        Then use a plane fitting algorithm
        Use plane as target transform, use spring to filter

    Foam where displacement maps are swished together (wave tops)
        "jacobian of displacements per frequency band"
    Explosions, wakes, don't displace the water
    Very cool protoype explosions:

    Keeping water out of the boat:
        use distance fields generated from the boat hull, 
        don't render within the distance field
    near land just bring waves down to level

Waves in Sprigland, 8/24/22:
  What have we learned:
    It's not easy to get the right parameters for gerstner waves
  What are the open questions:
    Do we need more resolution to our mesh before the waves look good?
      So far, it hasn't been easier with a tighter mesh
  What's the immediate, plausible path:
    Go back to the big mesh, unsubdivided, 
      get 2-3 waves that look passable but probably not great
    continue with other gameplay content
  eventually:
    [ ] higher LOD triangle meshes, tiled, follows camera
      - Falconeer uses ~60k tris
    [ ] sliders for real-time adjustment
    [ ]

New water TODO:
  [x] Try cel shading the water
  [ ] Bug: ensure wave dir aligns w/ world vec2
  [ ] Bug: fix wave length not matching world units
  [ ] Bug: fix crest speed not working right when length varies
  [ ] White foam; foam pattern
  [ ] Try evaluating gerstner in pixel shader for more detailed normal?
  [ ] Transparency / alpha
  [ ] Underwater shader
  [ ] Wake behind boat
  [ ] Fresnel effect
  [ ] Tweak gerstner definitions
  [ ] Fix PBR-ness of mesh colors + lights + lighting equations
  [ ] flow maps
  [ ] reflection
  [ ] refraction
