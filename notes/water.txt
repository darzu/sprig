    based on Tessendorf's "Simulating Ocean Water"
    Only needs time and parameters,
        clients and servers can simulate seperately
        infinite tiles, seamless transitions
    Downsides:
        Uses FFTs, "FFTs are expensive"
        large FFTs -> sacrafice perf
        small FFTs -> either you see patterns or not enough detail
        didn't like Phillips Spectrum
    Used 4 frequency bands
        These are just 4 tile sizes then combined ?
    Used:
        "duel fetch limited JONSWAP spectra"
            "Joint North Sea Wave Project"
        artistic control:
            wind speed, direction, fetch (?),
            spectrum peaking, directional distribution, override amplitude, low pass filter
    For buoyancy:
        Use discrete displacement samples along hull
        Then use a plane fitting algorithm
        Use plane as target transform, use spring to filter

    Foam where displacement maps are swished together (wave tops)
        "jacobian of displacements per frequency band"
    Explosions, wakes, don't displace the water
    Very cool protoype explosions:

    Keeping water out of the boat:
        use distance fields generated from the boat hull, 
        don't render within the distance field
    near land just bring waves down to level
