other conferences:
  "pixels"
    "equations"
    Siggraph, Eurographics, GDC, Digital Dragons, I3D, HPG, SCA, EGSR
    I3D: https://www.youtube.com/@I3DSymposium/videos
  "drawcalls"
    "algorithms"
    ie "how to commandeer our GPUs to do the work we want to do in an efficient fashion"
  why another?
    shiny pixels and fast draw calls are features of an engine
    what's harder to change is engine architecture
    architecture: design choices and trade offs + the product/people "why" behind them

hype-hype (hype!)
  Research
    first get dump of what hardware is being used: hardware manufactureres, etc
    minspec is the most important
      vulkan 1 + android 9 (32 bit + 64 bit)
        ARM: Mali-G series (bifrost)
        Qualcomm: Adreno 500 series
        PowerVR: 8000 series (Rogue)
      iphone 6s
        64-bit CPU, A9 / A8X
    cutting bottom 5% is okay, since new bottom 50% get much better experience and better user retention for all
    contacted hardware vendors, presenting early design
      ARM (Mali), Qualcomm (Adreno), PowerVR, Apple
      Present early design, get feedback
      read best practice guides
      
  Design
  Implementation
