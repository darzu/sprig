SVG 
  paths:
    M = moveto (move from one point to another point)
    L = lineto (create a line)
    H = horizontal lineto (create a horizontal line)
    V = vertical lineto (create a vertical line)
    C = curveto (create a curve)
    S = smooth curveto (create a smooth curve)
    Q = quadratic Bézier curve (create a quadratic Bézier curve)
    T = smooth quadratic Bézier curveto (create a smooth quadratic Bézier curve)
    A = elliptical Arc (create a elliptical arc)
      A rx ry x-axis-rotation large-arc-flag sweep-flag x y
      a rx ry x-axis-rotation large-arc-flag sweep-flag dx dy
      note: if end x,y are too far for rx,ry,x-axis-rotation, there's special rules to scale up the radius:

    Z = closepath (close the path)
  basic shapes:
    rectangle
    circle
    ellipse
    line
    polyline
    polygon

Curves and Surfaces:
  https://ciechanow.ski/curves-and-surfaces/
  two "rails" + dragged segment = surface
  if rails are bezier curves => bezier patches
  nurbs: b-splines w/ non-unform knots and adjustable control point weighting
  subdivision curves: repeatedly cut corners
    if u always cut 1/4 into a straight line, this converges to quadratic b-splines
  cut corners on surfaces:
    Catmull–Clark subdivision surfaces
    nicely smooth low-poly blocky meshes into progressively rounder meshes

    arc length approx: https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/#arclengthapprox

ideas:
  bezier curve progress isn't linear. 
    Can't we just apply some function to t to make it linear?
    or we can always resample into linear segments
