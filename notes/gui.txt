    constraint system, e.g.:
        constraints.setX(new CenterConstraint()) // centered horizontal
        constraints.setY(new PixelConstraint(20)) // 20 from top
        constraints.setWidth(new RelativeConstraint(20)) // 20% of width
        constraints.setHeight(new AspectConstraint(1)) // 1:1 aspect ratio
        display.add(uiElement, constraints)
    rounded corners
    whole UI is scalable
    transitions (slide and fade out), e.g.:
        new Transition().xDriver(new SlideTransition(0, 100)).alphaDriver(new SlideTransition(0, 1))

    text can word-wrap or scale with container

    replacement for react?
    "Svelte is a compiler that knows at build time how things could change in your app, rather than waiting to do the work at run time."

    "Tentative conclusion after being burned in performance too many times: Diffing (like in React, but by no means is this unique to React) is a sign that there's something wrong with your framework design."

    "Since we're a compiler, we can do that by instrumenting assignments behind the scenes:":
