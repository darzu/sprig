From games:
    Ghosts of Tsushima:
        Excellent use of photography for quest start/end
        Haiku minigame
        Great foliage and leaves
        You feel like a bad ass
    Spiderman:
        Fluid as hell movement
        Web is such a good movement gimick (which every open world game needs),
            this should probaby be stolen wholesale in more games
    God of War:
        Having a companion that's an important plot point makes a ton of sense
        Pretty, grandiose scale
    Horizon Zero:
        Great archery
        Takedowns are a puzzle
        Beautiful scenery
    Dark souls:
        Combat is slower pace and "simple"
        The game feels fair: it's your fault u died
        Enemy state machines are complex, sometimes they're easy, sometimes tough
