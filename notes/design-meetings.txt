talk with Doug oct 19th:
  has time stamp with senders clock
  can track a skew estimator
  snap hard all attributes
  simulate forward best as you can by dt
    simulating player might not be worth it
    bullet worth it
    maybe path projection?
    objects should have option to simulate themselves forward
    ballistic by default
      
  shooting at point blank range is weird

  problem:
    seeing bullet go through you

  guest fires bullet at host
  host is responsible for resolving collision
  guest is responsible for bullet's motion

  two ways to handle events:
   temp way: local thing
   auth way: gameplay impact

   non-rendering of bullet can be:
     runs every frame, doesn't change state
     "stateless" and "harmless"
   event represents a change in state

  ECS

  reference frame:
    tree of transforms
    gameplay lets you change the parent

  collider:
    rotated rectangles

  make it look cool?
    meshes for boats?
    object animations?
      walking animation of some kind
      animations need to be forward simulated
    abstract stuff: makes it clear its not the final project
    renderer: 
      [ ] shadows
      [ ] better looking materials

  TO FIX: webgl

EVENTS AGAIN:
  1. distributed event resolution based on who could possibly be involved in the event (instead of always the host)
  2. add sequence numbers to entities so that we can sync w/o syncing the whole log
  3. cannonical / non-reorderable state must be updated by events only
