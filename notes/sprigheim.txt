Approach:
    Heightmap
        Chunked
    Character
        Minecraft style?
            Doesn't work:
                Rolls, dodges, 
            Does work:
                Jumping
                Swing (simple)
        Full animation style?


Teaching:
    Show a tree (more trunk and off-shoots) of tutorials (kinda like a bioware game)
    You can either take the result (skip) or go down each branch
    Branches will be in one of three states:
        Complete
        Sketch
        TODO
    Users can vote for TODO or Sketch tutorials to be completed
        TODO tutorials have nothing or some text
        Sketch tutorials are recorded quickly in on pass with little/no editting
    E.g. 
        creating a 3d character
        animating a 3d character
    At the end of each tutorial:
        Talk about how this transfers to other tools (Unity, Blender, etc)
            What are the paths an indie dev can take?
            What are the paths a AAA dev takes?

Series of islands like Sea of Thieves using Redblob island generator
