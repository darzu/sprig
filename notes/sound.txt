Music Theory
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgaTLrZGlk0

concepts: 
    notes, chords, keys (home base?), scales, major (4-3) and minor (3-4) scales, 12 notes, octaves, 7 note subsets (scales), 

    diatonic 6 main chords: using roman numerals w/ uppercase is major lowercase is minor
    petatonic scale: 5 notes, take major and minor scales and remove 2 most dissonant notes
    melody notes play over cords with different quality depending if they are within or without that cord
    rythm is (typically) 4 bars per measure (typically), divide into 8ths using "&" and 16ths using "a" and "e" "1 e & a 2 e & a 3 ...."

    inversion: cycle the letters in a scale or chord? TODO

DIY w/ software:
    way to set scale
    select cord progressions (I, ii, iv etc)
    select melody notes

way to consume midi, decompose it into these concepts?
