// RESEARCH:
// block node types:
//    label, hole, nested block, image, toggle, text entry, number entry, 
// dropdowns:
//    variables, enum values (math operators, sprite kinds, animation state) 
//    some are drag-out-able, some aren't
// needs to support custom field editors
// what to do about "+" and "-" ?
// mouth hole vs inline hole
//    if-else statements have multiple mouths
// IDEAS:
// - instead of function blocks, have a "create a block" editor

// REQUIREMENTS:
// - WordWrap
//  - can WordWrap within labels
// - Auto-format by default
// - "Holes" for clicking to add
// - custom field editors
// - custom block inner rendering
// - highlighting
//    - hover (white) and click (yellow)
// - context options: Duplicate, Add Comment, Delete Block, Help, Delete All
// - undo / redo
// NICE TO HAVE:
// - keyboard nav
// - equation builder
// 
// BLOCK ORGANIZATION:
// - Tabs? Collapsing code blocks?
// - columns, namable
//    - two finger swipe / horizontal scroll changes column

// BLOCK STRUCTURE:
// TYPES: control flow (can have mouth), statement, expression
// namespace Block {
//   type Shape = "statement" | "event"
//   type Label = string
//   type Constraints = "none" // type, shape, 
//   interface HoleDef {
//     constraints: Constraints
//   }
//   interface CustomNode {
//     // e.g. image
//   }
//   interface MouthHole {
//   }
//   type NodeDef = Label | HoleDef | CustomNode | MouthHole
//   interface BlockDef {
//     shape: Shape;
//     nodes: NodeDef[];
//   }
// }

// block definition vs block instance

// each block is an svg element?
// goals: drag and drop, canvas movement

// RENDERING:
// corner shapes: triangle, "circle", rounded-box
// stack divot
// mouth
// function "hat"

// need:
// function to draw corner types
// function to run horizontal
// function to run verticle
// function to draw hats and shoes

//    - nesting: each layer adds width and height indentation
// example:
// if ( ( sprite vy (velocity y) > 0 and not is sprite hitting wall bottom) or sprite y < otherSprite top) then

// desirable breaking blocks: and, or, < >, break outermost first
/*
if (((sprite vy (velocity y) > 0)
     and not is sprite hitting wall bottom)
  or sprite y < otherSprite top) then
  */

// - first break in nodes indents
// - max width depends on whether or not it is indented (assume you're indented)

// WHY:
/*
- better understanding of blockly
- better understanding of SVG stuff
- proto wordwrap
- proto better blockly perf
- proto phone interface more quickly
- proto "hole" based block editting
- high motivation & inspiration
WHY NOT:
- ton of work
- sounds crazy

Cursed Problems in Game Design
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uE6-vIi1rQ
  Problems realign our thinking when they're well posed
  Good to know what cursed problems are so you don't naive think you can solve them
  Player Promises: A game's essential experiences. Why the player came to play.
    see: "Welcome to the Yard Sale" by Zak M
    promises live in the designers heart, and sometimes the players heart
  Cursed Problem: an unsolvable design problem rooted in a conflict between core player promises.
    Can't be solved directly, worked around by giving up strategicly
    common special case: conflict between promised experiences and objectives.
      experiences: the moment-by-moment gameplay
      objectives: what's pulling us through the game

  Examples:
    Free-for-All Politics:
      promise: I want to focus on combat mastery
      promise: I want to win
      politics: competition through social negotiation, alliances, and manipulation.
        see: "Characteristics of Games" (unrated)
      politics is at odds with technical execution
    Quarterbacking problem:
      in a coop game, someone starts steering everyone else
      promise: I want to have a cooperative experience
        requires player independence
      promise: I want to play to win
        requires central decision making
    Skill Inflation Problem:
      For evergreen games, the longer the game is on the market the better everyone is
      promise: I want a long journey of mastery
        requires: rising skill pool
      promise: I want a stable, vibrant community
        requires: broad variety of skill levels
    Commodified Reward Problem:
      e.g. diablo loot marketplace
    Life Disruption Problem:
      e.g. Pokemon Go
    Quantified Creativity Problem:
      I want to express myself: Intrinsic goal following
      I want to progress my character: Extrinsic goal following
      (Extrinsic seems to win over intrinsic in games and in life)

    Game, spot the cursed problem:
      No Man's Sky: millions of worlds vs diverse, interactive ecosystems
        Daryl: Just Hard. 
        Alex: Yup, just hard.
      Loot games with efficient trading: rich loot experience vs ubiquitous market place
        Daryl: Cursed. 
          I want to care about the loot item not just the value.
          Marketplace will quickly become a fn of rarity and utility.
        Alex: Cursed.
          Varied loot drop experience vs Items fungible for one another
      Always on location based games (Pokemon Go): 
        rewards at specific times and places vs need for personal safety and convenience
        Daryl: Just hard, if you could encode your safety and convenience constraints it'd be fine.
          but effectively cursed because you can't totally encode that.
        Alex: Cursed.
          Play anywhere, anytime vs Only play when appropriate
    
    Working around cursed problem by making sacrafices:
      Think of the player moving through the play space, 
        the time they spend in experiences they don't want in order to 
        achieve an objective is maybe a cursed problem

      1. Barriers (keep the player in the "happy land")
        e.g. for FFA politics: limit players agency over one another (foot race, battle royal,)
      2. Gates (make it harder for the player to leave "happy land")
        e.g. for FFA politics: limit players visiblity of each other's success
      3. Carrots (incentive to avoid bad states)
        e.g. for FFA politics: add meta-game effects
      4. S'mores (make it fun)
        e.g. for FFA politics: give players tools for deep political play e.g. secrecy

    Psychologically, humans think a game is fair when they win ~70% of the time

  If you frame your problem the same way as everyone else, you'll get the same answers
  If you frame your problem in a new ay, new answers will arise
  Games attract us because they yield emotional experiences they find full filling
    Arcade emotions: suspense, triumph, defeat
  Graphics: not ugly, easily identifiable, minimal noise, intensity hierarchy, fast implementation, leave room for interpretation
  everything ambiguous is interpreted as tribal, interpersonal politics
    probably because the part of our mind that interprets social interactions is over developed
    "germany did this, france did that"
  storys r made of emotions and intentions
  apophenia
  task selection super critical:
    process: 
      satisficing (chose first acceptable option)
      optimizing (compare all options, chose the best)
    plans are a problem:
      discard inspiration,
      discard feedback,
      discard test learning,
  Ludeon method:
    every idea -> MASSIVE ideas reservoir (sort regularly) -> per-person todo list
    big list is essentially bubble sorted
    ordering is often changed, nothing is fixed. When something is locked, its your mind not wanting to do work
    redeciding over time reduces bias, not just one point in time
    future knowledge advantage: you have the most information possible since ur acting late
    status quo bias: bias towards keeping the plan
    ideas fight there way to the top,
      you might think an idea is really good but it has to compete vs everything else
    ship-necessary razor: is it possible to ship without?
      e.g. character animations, turns out, no one cared
    when doing something contrarian:
      need deep belief, you won't get as much validation from social stuff around you
      we try to merge our beliefs with those around us
    consider that in indie games: middle road beliefs get you middle road results: failure

Daryl's pet theory about puzzlers: it's the default answer to game design when
    you can't come up with compelling gameplay.
    E.g. infinifactory and other zachtronic games, the factories don't contribute
      to anything so just make some self contained challenge they need to solve.
      Compare to something like factorio or space engineers where engineering solves
        interesting gameplay goals

Revisting Rust vs TS:
  Sprigland long-term components:
    Games
      game logic
      custom engine components
    Game engine: 
      rendering, 
      physics, 
      networking, 
      ECS, 
      libraries,
      in-game UI
    Block based editor
      outputs game logic
      maybe outputs custom engine components
      outputs shaders (?)
    Asset editors
      3D assets
      textures (?)
      pixel art (?)
      level design
    GPU tool (?)
      outputs shaders
      outputs descriptors: buffers, textures, pipelines, etc
    Learning content  
      Videos
      Interactive blogs
      In-editor tutorials

  Types of code:
    game logic:
      ECS heavy, reading/writing systems, defining components, 
      still plenty of vectors, matrices, etc
      goal: ECS-aware, engine-specific-aware scripting language
        translatable to-from block language
    game engine:
      low-ish level, bit packing, tight loops,
    UIs/IDEs/Editors:
      windows, tabs, buttons, controls, text,
      resize, layout, grid, flex,
      accessibility (!!)
    
  Goals worth revisting:
    Full TS<->block language
      I had a fairly certain vision of this 
      but maybe full parity is too restrictive?
    Static compiling Typescript
      makecode did this, fairly confident I could do this
      but maybe if you're going to write a compiler, just make a different language
  
  Problems with typescript:
    Lack of stack-allocated types for vecs, matrics, small structs
    No (first-class) explicit number types e.g. u64, f32, etc.
    Hard to track memory leaks; hard to see allocations
    Long past the hype days of JS/TS excitement
    Electron seen in a bad light
    TS isn't a serious player in games
    V8/jit bloats the binary
    performance cliffs, hard to anticipate

  Benefits of typescript:
    Good DOM/HTML/CSS integration, therefore tons of web tech esp UI for "free"
      accessibility! Rust UI solutions have major problems here
    Web HTML/CSS is de-facto for interactive learning content
    Great typechecker, very "moddable", easy to create custom language services
    Can probably be both the engine and the scripting language
    speed of coding: i doubt Rust will ever outpace TS in terms of building a thing
      (C++ programmers claim this too... but they're wrong)

  Benfits of Rust:
    The "right" language. It's efficient and high level.
    High hype levels right now, free marketing
    No waste/high efficiency; the right language for performance
    Could revisit Bevvy, Rapier, and other libraries
    
  Problems with Rust:
    UI, esp accessibility, isn't solved
    Slower typechecker, unfamiliar with "moddability"
      bevvy people aren't doing custom language services

  GUI:
    HTML/CSS -> obvious choice, accessible, unlimited options, productive
      some hard limitions: limited context menu, OS/browser-controlled zoom, accidental text selection, gestures
    in-engine -> needed for in-game UI; way more fun to make for dz; not accessible!

  Inertia:
    we've put a year+ effort into the current code base
    but the value is in the abstractions and learnings made along the way
    but how many abstractions will translate nicely to Rust? Probably all

  Hypothesis worth revisiting:
    We only need ~PS2.5 era graphics
      The thing is, u can always do more with that extra efficiency
      But Rust vs TS is all about CPU and memory, 
        maybe that just doesn't matter so much

  Web platform:
    Running on the web means JS or WASM
    in theory: Can always start w/ JS and add in WASM modules
    but if you're not using any of {DOM,HTML,CSS,JS} might as well be fully native->WASM

Teaching idea:
  Instead of tutorial (or in addition to), drop the user
  in a very limited environment where they have just a few
  possible knobs they can turn and challenge them to make
  three different games that seem perhaps impossible at first
  to make
  Limits r everything!

More on teaching:
  At the end of a tutorial / challenge, present the user an
  option:
    build a game (practice existing knowledge) 
    or learn a new thing
  Put a strong recommendation forward so there's an opinion,
  but don't be so patronizing that u assume u always know better
  Try and calibrate the recommendation based on how the creator
  has been doing

IDE teaching ideas:
  Have the UI be turn-on-able via check boxes that slowly get
  ticked on as the user learns things. Like a good city builder.
  However, the user can also uncheck everything if it's been a while
  and they want to start fresh.
  Unity just dumps you this huge IDE way too early.

"How I learned Unity without following tutorials (Developing 1)":
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFjXKOXdgGo
  Three steps:
    Learn the basics
    Familiarize urself with the basics (repeat)
    Slowly add to ur repretoir
  Basics:
    What is a game object?
    How to make one game object interact with another game object?
    How to spawn in objects? And then delete them?
    How to make something happen when two objects collide?
    How to do UI? Sound effects? Animation?
    How to deal with levels and game over?
  Repeat:
    plagerize; copy basic games out there
    make the steps really simple for yourself

Barycentric rendering:

Environment design:
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VkrExQwSo
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L27Qb20AYmc
  Personality in a space:
    behavioral traces (e.g. a messy desk),
    identity claims (e.g. photographs on the wall)
    mood modifiers (e.g. music, candle light)
  Mimesis
    Roleplaying
    Personality
    Affordances
    Sizes
    Layout
  Semiotics:
    Signifiers 
      symbols: culturally arbitrary, e.g. language words, stop sign
      icon: resembles what it is signifying
      indexes: e.g. smoke is an index signifier for fire
    Aesthetic Language
      Shape language
        to design a silo door, u could:
          shape language: copy style of existing marine machinery doors
          roleplaying engineer: work from the principles of physics to design a door
    Tropes
      Metonymy: e.g. White House to refer to US Gov
      Synecdoche: e.g. Eifel Tower to refer to Paris
  Cognition:
    Associations
      color preferences are partially culturally motivated
    Spatial:
      brain uses real-world spacial mapping to understand social mapping
        e.g. John is {close to, distant to, ahead of, above, below} me
    Peak shift:
      exaggerate features that are different from normal e.g. a caricature
        e.g. feature prominently in frame: the hollywood sign, cactus, golf course, mountain lookout


Teaching programming idea:
  first, don't even start with code
  imagine two blocks, red and blue, and u could snap them together
    to see a different result on the screen
  U learn ordering, and playing with physical things with limits and behavior
  think Baba is You
  At some point ask: Would you like to build a 3D rendering engine from scratch?
    Yes, No, Later
    Later marks it as a TODO

Game of Life the Roguelike idea:
  U start as a young kid,
  Limited time before u advance to the next stage: youth, young adult, mid age, older, acient
  Different perks each time,
    u get reputation based on what you did before
    challenges change
  maybe u can get coffee with a nemisis from an earlier stage
  then u die and that's 1 run
