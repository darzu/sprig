        R6 vs R15
        avatar properties: 
            cartoon <-> human
            height, width, head size
            slender vs thick
        supports import from blender
            body parts must be seperate models
            "skinning" is more complex

Sphere:
    Fibinacci sphere: even Distribution of points
    Redblob
    icosphere

Compute shaders:
    mass parallel processing on GPU
    "smooth min" functions for merging shapes and functions nicely

3D editor:
    quad-based mesh editor:
        loop cuts
        extrude
            normal extrude
        merge
        unmerge?
    side, top, front, perspective view (like tinkerCAD)
    symetry modes
    vertices move:
        edge slide
        x,y,z slide
        scale
    equipment attach points
        clothing, armor, weapons,
        mech parts,


Low Poly advice:
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1oNuKChsdU
        Consider a consistent atom-size
        Recommends hand-done LODs
        Consider low-res
        scrolling UV maps, normal maps
