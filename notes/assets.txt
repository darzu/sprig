TO LEARN:
    UV Wraps ?
      same thing as UV mapping; just the 2d<->3d bijection between texture and vertices 

Procedural by example:

Sphere:
    Fibinacci sphere: even Distribution of points
    Redblob
    icosphere

Compute shaders:
    mass parallel processing on GPU
    "smooth min" functions for merging shapes and functions nicely

        loop cuts
        extrude
            normal extrude
        merge
        unmerge?
    side, top, front, perspective view (like tinkerCAD)
    symetry modes
    vertices move:
        edge slide
        x,y,z slide
        scale
    equipment attach points
        clothing, armor, weapons,
        mech parts,


Low Poly advice:
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1oNuKChsdU
        Consider a consistent atom-size
        Recommends hand-done LODs
        Consider low-res
        scrolling UV maps, normal maps

  e.g.: https://twitter.com/delaneykingrox/status/1593289402058706944

Perforce:
  Talked to Taylor
  Perforce Helix Core
  Free version: 5 people, 1,000 files, "unlimited" file size
  Beyond 5 people: ~$400/year/person including first 5
    might be able to get discount from sales folks

"Physically Based Modeling":
  Board paths
    wood panels
  metal bar & pipe paths
  lathe paths
    clay, wood, metal
  glass panes (flat polygons)
    stainable and joinable w/ wire
  carved/chisled/sculpted:
    just regular meshes?
    wood has: grain direction
    [ ] can we exploit the subtractive nature? or the additive nature?
    [ ] track each carve?
  [ ] forged iron: what structure can we exploit?
    is it just a path of varying thickness and rotations?

3D modeler using common game control scheme:
  - WASD moves your avatar/camera
  - "hot bar" assigns "tools" to 1-9
  maybe also:
  - inventory has tools and assets to use
  - character sheet lets you customize
  - travel to different places in the world to do different tasks

Pixel art app:
  Like dotpict etc.
  Drag one finger, confirm other
  But:
  One button eye drop
