From GameDev reddit on Networking:
    Although online games are fun to play, be aware that networking will suck your time and that it doesn't only involve sending a message back and forth. Lag compensation, dead-reckoning, bad connections, bad computers, proper physics and preventing cheating are all things to care about for a real-time game. Turn-based multiplayer games are way easier to design.

        https://gist.github.com/gafferongames/bb7e593ba1b05da35ab6

Techniques:
    Deterministic lockstep:
        Con: need to wait for input from all players to run simulation, best for 2-4 players
        Con: deterministic physics is hard
        Pro: very compact bandwidth
        Good for RTS and turn-based
    Snapshots + interpolation + delta compression
        Hermite Interpolation is much better for rotations
        Con: more bandwidth
        ~10pps gives very good results
        interpolation buffer should have enough delay so you can lose two packets in a row
            ~10pps goes to ~350ms delay
            ~30pps goes to ~150ms delay
            ~60pps goes to ~85ms delay
    State synchronization
        send state and input
        pro: doesn't require deterministic physics
        con: extrapolation divergence happens, leads to bugs and "pops"
        optimizations:
            use "has changed" bits
            other bit packing applies
            "serialization function": https://gafferongames.com/post/serialization_strategies/
            send multiple redundent inputs (like det-lockstep)
            use a prioritization scheme to select ~64 most important updates
                use "priority accumulator" to focus on most important (player, interacting) but eventually service all objects.
            bandwidth limit: use prioritization scheme to set dynamic bandwidth limits
            use jitter buffer
            quantize both sides
        Reduce popping:
            Don't render at simulation location, instead render at sim location lerp'ed w/ error
            Use different smoothing amounts: 
                0.95 for small jitter (<25cm), 0.85 (>1m), lerp between
        Delta compression
            Store positions as relative to player
            per-object ack's and diffing
            bidirectional acks are complicated:
                https://gafferongames.com/post/reliability_ordering_and_congestion_avoidance_over_udp/
            bump priority of objs at rest that haven't been ack'ed
        
Learnings:
    You can often trade latency for smoothness
    To lower latency, you can use extrapolation, which can be hard
    Position is often the hardest to compress well
    RTT: round trip time

bandwidth optimizations:
    any numerical:
        bound and quantize
        use known relations (e.g. "smallest three")
    smallest three (for quantenion):
        send only three members
        w = sqrt( 1 - x^2 - y^2 - z^2 )
        (x,y,z,w) = (-x,-y,-z,-w) # no sign bit required
        TODO: another optimization something with (v,v,0,0)
        possible to turn 128bits into 29bits
    compress velocity:
        bound and quantize
            e.g. Set max speed bounds and stepping (e.g. max: 32 m/s, step: 1 m/s)
            e.g. [0,2047]
        track "at rest" bit
        depending on transfer frequency, might be best to switch back to lerp
    compress position:
        bound and quantize
            e.g. [-131072,+131071] // x,y
            e.g. [0,16383] // z
        e.g. 50 bits per absolute position
    delta compression:
        simplest: 1 bit per obj that hasn't changed
        reciever sends "ack"
        sender sends delta relative to last ack'ed
    small wins:
        send only changed objs with a obj index and assume others are unchanged
            for 10 bit indices, indices are more efficient for <=90 cubes
            calculate per snapshot which encoding to use
        send indices as relative offsets from previous indices
            e.g.:
                [1,8] => 1 + 3 (4 bits)
                [9,40] => 1 + 1 + 5 (7 bits)
                [41,900] => 1 + 1 + 10 (12 bits)
                => avg 5.5 bits (instead of 10) per index
            note this makes swapping encodings between index objs vs all objs more complicated
        encode position relative to snapshot
            collected runtime data
            used a script to determine most efficient encoding of the sample data
                e.g. result: delta [-16,+15], delta [-256,+255], absolute
                    => 26.1 bits per position
        Delta Encoding Smallest Three
            tried and failed:
                4D delta components + smallest three like above
                delta whole orientation (only 90% better)
            per 3 components:[-16,+15] small, [-128,+127] large
                => 23.3 bits per relative quantenion
        One change bit for position, one for orientation
            e.g. 5% changed didn't rotate, 5% changed didn't move
                => save 2 bits per cube
        Estimate angular velocity using previous orientations to predict new orientations
    context aware arithmetic encoding:
        https://github.com/rygorous/gaffer_net/blob/master/main.cpp
        25% better than bit packing

    https://github.com/fbsamples/oculus-networked-physics-sample
    Options:
        Deterministic lockstep
            subtype: "rollback networking" or GGPO
                Used by basically all fighting games
                Great for simple physics where ~25x physics steps per frame isn't hard
        Client/server with client-side prediction
        Distributed simulation with authority scheme (*chosen*)
            Players take authority over objs they interact with
    authority schemes:
        What if two players interact with the same set of objs?
        What if two players try to take authority at once (masked by latency)?
        Intuition: since state is exchanged rapidly (~60hz), handle in protocol encoding
        Authority: last touched wins, transitive (thrown cube claims authority over those it hits)
        Ownership: once taken, player keeps it until relinquished
    lossy bandwidth optimizations made PhysX behave badly
        need to set maxDepenetrationVelocity
        need custom 'at rest' detection
    priority accumulator:
        negative and positive values (neg clears accum)
        boost priority for objs likely involved in divergence
    per-cube snapshoting and delta compression
        need reliability ack's
        lots of code complexity
    included a fancy ballistics predictor
        cubes that follow the prediction get another bit: "perfect prediction"
    regret: using smallest-three
    recommend: use a arithmetic compressor
    (months of work to this point)
    ! all the above looked awful for avatars
        because of timestep issues (FixedUpdate vs Update)
        100ms jitter buffer
        include held cubes as part of avatar instead of physics sim (neg priority)
    one player is the "host"
        all packets flow through, they are the arbiter
        host can override ownership & authority
        at rest cubes go back to host (I think?)
        
Unity multiplayer:
    "MLAPI"
    "Transport"
        What does "jobified client and server" mean?
        options: UnetTransport, ???
    Boss Room example
    https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/blog
    User burden:
        Create a singleton "NetworkManager"
        Switch on "client" vs "server" vs "host"
        Create component which inherits from "NetworkBehaviour"
        Create properties with type NetworkVariableVector3
            Write perms: ServerOnly
            Read perms: Everyone
        Annotate methods with "[ServerRpc]", e.g.:
            [ServerRpc]
            void SubmitPositionRequestServerRpc(ServerRpcParams rpcParams = default)
            {
                Position.Value = GetRandomPositionOnPlane();
            }
        clients can request a server runs some code, these keeps everything in the client perspective when coding
        manually need to keep local rigidbody transform in sync:
             void Update()
            {
                transform.position = Position.Value;
            }
        there's a singleton "PlayerObject" on the client?
            if (NetworkManager.Singleton.ConnectedClients.TryGetValue(NetworkManager.Singleton.LocalClientId, out var networkedClient))
            {
                var player = networkedClient.PlayerObject.GetComponent<HelloWorldPlayer>();
                if (player)
                {
                    player.Move();
                }
            }
        "NetworkTransform" is a component synchronized between client and server
        Also [ClientRpc] exists

    MLAPI:
        NetworkObjects
            has NetworkId
            NetworkTransform, NetworkBehavior, and NetworkVariable need to be childed under one
            has owner
            SoftSync vs PrefabSync
                PrefabSync is "ONLY recommended for multi project setups"
        NetworkBehavior
        PlayerObject is a simplification for when there's just one
        Spawning is something the user has to care about
        data structures: NetworkVariable, NetworkList and NetworkDictionary
            for keeping state in sync
        Host/server can control custom "visibility" criteria for clients
        programmer concerns:
            scene switching
            obj network visiblity per client
            spawning/despawning
            object pooling

    input delay is not an option
        need client prediction for rigid bodies
    server can't wait for client input
        results in non determinism between player and server
    collisions with moving objects
    100% server authority
    lag compensation in FPS:
        client send a packet saying, hey I shot that player at this time,

Overwatch netcode:
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=
    Great talk about how to do ECS at scale

    ECS is for integrating a bunch of systems together, 
        it shouldn't force its design principles where it isn't welcome
        ECS is glue
            Enforces constraints on your glue code
        ECS minimizes coupling
        Netcode is tricky so decouple it
        Only a handful of people will touch your physics or your audio, 
            but everyone is going to touch the glue that holds everything together

    Many systems (and the components they operate on) are often ice-berg shaped. 
        They have a small surface area that systems can touch, 
        with a large amount of complexity under the water.

    Post mortem:
        Deferring creation was a mistake, but it's a difficult problem

    Systems strictly define the tuple of components they depend on at compile time
        This allows multi-threading b/c you can have a clear D-DAG

    ECS rules:
        Components have no functions
        Systems have no state
            This requirement was necessary for kill cam
            Embraced singleton components
        Shared code in utils
        Complex side-effects should be deferred
            by enqueuing them in components, preferably singleton components
        Systems can't call other systems

    Quantized to 1m/1024

    `if you take away one lesson from this talk let it be this - 
    behaviors are much less complex if they are expressed in a 
    single callsite, in which all major behavioral sideeffects 
    are localized to that callsite`

https://johanhelsing.studio/posts/introducing-matchbox
    web Rust, peer-to-peer webrtc


Reconnect and save/loading:
    Server has in a worker thread a listner that listens to all network traffic
        and records state update deltas with periodic snapshots
    This should be pretty close to the logic we need for a full match replay and history rewind system
    The local storage listener can send back out messages that represent the full state of the game
    When the host loads a saved game this should be semantically the same as a new player joining an existing game
    Saving and loading a game should use exactly the same serialize/deserialize paths as the net code


"in contact" event ambiguity:
    player 2 has obj hit the ground
    event is:
        id, type, list of object ids
    the game has interpretation of what each type means
    for each obj id, the smallest authority wins
    refinement:
        the game has interpretation of how each type resolves authority
    we need incremental obj vs previous state physics checks
    possibly soft cap on velocity based on ping
        max distance for error
        network physics position error tolerance
    if we do physics for forward sim, we could ship desired veloicty

    for now: physics touching check
