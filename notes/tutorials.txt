From the Portal guys:
    You really want the player to figure it out instead of you telling them
    they remember it better, and have the epiphony moment
    get rid of false negatives: 
        make sure they know when they didn't get it
        make sure they get it when they should have
    new mechanic:
        introduction -> saturation -> graduation -> combination

Each feature we add:
    step 1. exploration: from the simple-cube example (or other minimal dependencies), build the feature
    step 2. implementation: take what we've learned, apply it to our existing system
    step 3. edge cases, debugging, clean up
