  naomi writing is just meeting notes back and forth
  character-driven writting
    people don't connect with a civilazation as a hole,
    so had to be character driven
  each writting:
    what's happening
    ptr to next clue
    back ptr to indicate how u could have gotten here,
      so u can follow the story the other direction
  characters r attached to certain plot lines
  players expected text to be lore, not game play
    had to make it clear: never lore, only text
  knew they needed shiplog b/c didn't want player using paper notes
    rumor board was a late addition

  Seemed both too complicated and too simple?
  Congnative load:
    too little -> boring
    too much -> overwhelming
  it's good to dive into apparent contradictions
    first, make examples concrete
  in a resource gathering game, you need "sinks" that take resources
  "What do you want the player to do?"
    systems/mechanics/features u want players to engage with
    how do they compose to create gameplay possibilities
  "Why is the player willing to do it?"
    rewards, mastery, joy, fantasy fulfillment
  regularly ask: "what is this for?"

"Platformer Toolkit Video Essay":

Pretty decent glossery of functional programming terms:
  https://github.com/hemanth/functional-programming-jargon#monad
  could do something similar for game / rendering stuff
  
Portals:
  Psychonauts 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-Z1Fx0LvDc
    meh, too unreal-specific. I think we can do this easier with stencils and composing
    constraints to make it easier:
      no enemy AI
      no recursion (can't see 1 through another)
      avoid seeing two portals at once

Regarding creative work:
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wLP0izeJE
  Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, and I really wish somebody had told this to me.
  All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But it's like there is this gap. For the first couple years that you're making stuff, what you're making isn't so good. It’s not that great. It’s trying to be good, it has ambition to be good, but it’s not that good.
  But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is good enough that you can tell that what you're making is kind of a disappointment to you. A lot of people never get past that phase. They quit.
  Everybody I know who does interesting, creative work they went through years where they had really good taste and they could tell that what they were making wasn't as good as they wanted it to be. They knew it fell short. Everybody goes through that.
  And if you are just starting out or if you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Do a huge volume of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week or every month you know you're going to finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you're going to catch up and close that gap. And the work you're making will be as good as your ambitions.
  I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It takes awhile. It’s gonna take you a while. It’s normal to take a while. You just have to fight your way through that.

Maps of Science, interactive wall idea:
  Get every poster from this channel, Domain of Science
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohyai6GIRZg
  Put them all on a grid on a big piece (or several connectable pieces) of plywood
  In the center of all of them will be a monitor, speaker, and raspberry pi (or similar)
  Each one will have a button; when pressed it'll play the relevant video for that poster
  Optionally, each also has a slider
     which dictates where in the video it should play when u press the button
     this lets u seek, ff, rewind, etc
  Optionally, the monitor has buttons for different language subtitles
  Optionally, the posters are tagged with little timestamps (or slider indicators) so u know where to seek to hear about that section
    perhaps this is printed on a transparent overlay per poster (maybe talk to Dom about this)
    or more extreme: little buttons for each section
  Maybe projector instead of monitor
  Maybe not one giant wall, but arranged like a mounted book with big sheafs u can browse

  Sprigland could absolutely do something like this for the realms of video game engines and computer science

Outward dev story:
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRNLemK6n7I

  Timeline something like:
  Guillaume saves up ~25k working at Activision as Q/A tester,
  tries 3 times to make a side project happen at Activision with other Activision people,
  quits Activision on good terms,
  1 year on a game (Brand) with ~5 people, revenue shared, no salary, game earns $30k,
  2.5 years on a game (God Factory) with ~8 people, revenue shared, minimum wage?, game earns $300k,
  he takes ~50k in loans
  2 failed kickstarters
  5/8 people live in one shitty apt (?),
  ~8 people make tech demo for open world RPG in ~3 months,
  receives 1 million from Canadian Media fund (gov thing?)
  spend 2 years on Outward, run out of money,
  decide early access would require too much comprise of vision, (surprising to me)
  so they get a publisher,
  work another 2.5 years on Outward,
  launches on March 2019,
  by Dec 2019 (this interview), game has sold ~500k copies

  development time: jit mode (using libtcc)
  ship time: optimizing compiler to C++ (estimated 3x faster)
  This split makes a ton of sense since a dev machine can be >3x better than min-spec device
  "member_frame" ?
    Lets u see past frame data, handled by the language
  Principles: early, unique, specific
    do things as early as possible (compile time vs runtime)
      early things are easier for later things to depend on but not vice versa
  "The minecraft generation will easily give up 10x in geometric detail just to gain a small amount of agency over the world"
    "dynamic modifications of anything should never cause a longer frame"
