    "make sure your diffuse colors are around 0.2, and no much brighter except for very special situations."
    "Don't even bother trying to do tweak lights, materials, diffuse fallof shapes or anything if you don't 
        have the gamma correction curve in the end of your rendering pipeline. Really..."
    "please, do not modulate the sun light with ambient occlusion!!"
    "[...] replace the sky dome with a single directional light falling straight vertically on the set. 
        You can colorize the light based on the angle of incidence if you need to create sunset sky lighting."
    " since indirect lighting has to be gathered in the hemisphere, using the same ambient occlusion 
        signal used for the sky dome works okeish in this case as well."

Ambient Occlusion:
    https://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/multiresaocc/multiresaocc.htm
        "the most popular technique among the hobbyists has been the SSAO"
        "[SSAO] is also the most abused and probably wrongly applied effect (closely followed by bloom)"
        main issues of SSAO: halos, performance, and range of distances at which the technique produces results
        "One mistake most beginners do is to use the occlusion as a multiplier to the whole lighting equation. 
            That's is NOT A GOOD IDEA"
        ""Ambient" [...] probably means all lights but the key lights, meaning the sky dome lighting, 
            all of the bounce lighting, and the rims"
        "do not implement the infamous "hemispherical occlusion""

TO LEARN:
    screen space ambient occlusion (SSAO)
        "reflection based dithering"
        dithering: "none, per pixel 2d rotation matrix or random reflection vector"
        "you can do this at a quarter resolution and then bilaterally upsample"
    color bleeding (SSCB)
    physically correct specular BRDFs
    Box Projected IBL (reflections)

PBR basics:
    https://developer.playcanvas.com/en/user-manual/graphics/physical-rendering/
    Diffuse: aka albedo
    Specular: aka reflected 
    energy conservation: more reflection means less albedo
    metalness: metals tend to be more reflective and non-metals reflect white usually
    Fresnel: "angle at which you are viewing a surface influences how reflective that surface appears"
    Microsurface: aka roughness/glossiness

"Geometry shaders":
  " are for creating new geometry on the fly. It's taking geometry of one type as input, and then 
  emitting a different number of the same, or another type of geoAmetry as output. You could have 
  points transformed to a series of triangles or quads."

3D Game Shaders for Beginners
  https://github.com/lettier/3d-game-shaders-for-beginners
  With multiple lights, accumulate diffuse and specular per light
  For each shadow casting light, store a shadow map and shadowView matrix
  four main vectors per fragment: 
    vector to the light (light dir) [w/ norm: "angle of incidence"]
    normal
    reflection (mirrors light dir) [w/ norm: "angle of reflection"]
    view vector towards the camera
  types of lights: direction, point, spotlight
  spotlights use spotDirection and spotCosCutoff
  attenuation, light's influence based on distance
  to combine diffuse & specular use addition
  "There should only ever be one ambient light", uses special ambient color (seperate from diffuse)
  This is known as "Phong" lighting?
  Blinn-Phong: produces elliptical specular reflections vs spherical specular reflections
    sometimes more computationally efficient
  Fresnel: "alters the reflectiveness of a surface based on the camera or viewing angle"
    essential for water: looking straight on you can see through water, at shallow view it's like a mirror
  rim highlighting: brighter light towards edges  
  Cel shading: 2D obj looks 3D by applying gradiant; 3D obj looks 2D by discretizing
  Deferred rendering:
    a screen space lighting technique
    wait to perform the lighting calc until after the geometry fragments have been culled
    phase 1: save positions/depths, normals, materials (for each fragment?) to geometry buffer (G buffer)
      "this is mostly a read-only phase so its performance cost is minimal"
    phase 2: compute ambient, diffuse, and specular colors plus Shadow and normal mapping
    forward: scales with lights x fragments
    deferred: scales with lights x pixels
    disadvantages: transparency, memory usage, AA
  blurs: box/mean (simplest), Gaussian (fancier), median (maintains edges, difficult to compute), Kuwahara (maintains edges, faster than median)
  bloom:
    parameters: size, seperation, threshold, amount,


  float diffuseIntensity = dot(normal, unitLightDirection);
  if (diffuseIntensity < 0.0) { continue; } // move to next light
  diffuseTemp = clamp(diffuseTemp, vec4(0), diffuseTex); 
  float specularIntensity = max(dot(reflectedDirection, eyeDirection), 0);
  // default: constAtt = 1, linAtt = 0, quadAtt = 1
  float attenuation = 1 / (constAtt + linAtt * lightDistance + quadAtt * (lightDistance * lightDistance));
  vec4 outputColor = ambient + diffuse + specular + p3d_Material.emission;
  // with fresnel:
  vec4 specular = materialSpecularColor * lightSpecularColor * pow(max(dot(eye, reflection), 0.0), shininess);
  float rimLightIntensity = max(0.0, 1.0 - dot(eye, normal));
  // with rim:
  vec4 outputColor = ambient.rgb + diffuse.rgb + specular.rgb + rimLight.rgb + emission.rgb;
  // with cell shading: (ditto with specular)
  diffuseIntensity = step(0.1, diffuseIntensity); // step() returns 0 if input < edge else 1.
  float fogIntensity = clamp((position.y - near) / (far - near), fogMin, fogMax);

  thread hierarchy:
    thread, 
    subgroup
      always power of 2
      8-64 is common
      fast subgroup operations
    workgroup, 
      ~64-1024
      can synchronize and communicate within, but not without
      ~32kb shared
    dispatch
      1000-10,000s of threads
  shaders can not (in general):
    recurse, function ptrs, sync outside workgroup, 
    ptrs outside descriptors/bindings, dynamic mem alloc,
    spawn more work,
