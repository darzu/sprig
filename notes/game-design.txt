    The Red Flag List:
    1. I don't give a crap about your back story.
    2. I don't give a crap about your inventory system either.
    3. I'm not going to design your game for you.
    4. Pillars are not hooks!
    5. You never explained what the player does.
    6. Don't use realism to excuse bad design.
    7. You don't need a framing device if it's not necessary.
    8. Is it really a game, or just a knockoff?
    9. You never mentioned your glaringly obvious tech risk.
    10. Your proof of concept does not prove your concept.
    11. Having lots of shitty art doesn't make them less shitty.
    12. I can't tell what's placeholder and what's not.
    13. You polished too early.
    14. Your sample dialog sucks.
    15. You're pandering to the latest tech craze.
    16. You just pitched a phone game to a console publisher.
    17. You're making a Gone Home/Minecraft/PUBG ripoff.
    18. You want us to negotiate a risky IP deal for you.
    19. I know more about your monetization than your mechanics.
    20. You have no idea how much money/people/time you need to make this thing.
    21. You don't have a team.
    22. Your business plan is based on outliers.
    23. You seem like you'd be a huge pain in the ass to work with.
    24. You expect me to know who you are.
    25. You're annoyed that I'm asking questions.
    26. We're trying to watch the pitch on your phone.
    27. You brought a laptop, but no headphones.
    28. You're hungover/drunk/high.
    29. Don't trash other games/companies/developers.
    30. You need to take a shower.  

    The Root Questions:
    A. Is this game worth making?
    B. Can this team make the game?

    Dos:
    Be enthusiastic
    Be honest
    Sell your hook
    Know your scope

local coop, single screen, one joy-con games:
    dungeon crawler (twin sticks but not)
    overcooked
    fighting
        duck game
        smash bros
    unrailed
    
We need log on server:
    with hats,
        someone has authority over hats
        event authority is hat owner
        interacting with field on player that gets synced
    RPC with server
    
Unrailed Post Mortem:
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXdNYkB90hk
    timeline:
        first did a mock up in blender
        then created a physical board game prototype
        then basic game as a student project
        then funding for bigger game
    problem: not clear enough goal
    solution 1: short term goals:
        make it to the next station
        secondary objective
        the bolt (quest)
    the incentives for those became a currency for upgrades
    the shop:
        originally idea was that players could vote on upgrades
        instead it became obvious what peoples intents where based on position
        and you could "vote" against them by dashing into them forcing them to drop the wagon
    biomes:
        originally random, with monotonic increasing speed
        now: biomes are progression with speed reset
        push your luck mechanic of staying in biome to get more bolts
    mp:
        communication via emojis
    map gen:
        "we are pretty certain they are solvable"
    felt most demotivated towards release it seemed?
        having a new partner helped motivation (bilibili)
    working on game for 9 mon before early access
    down to 3 people 2 weeks before launch
    expectations:
        no financial success, end after release
    players per day was steadily downward after launch
    their game was mentioned on some game show
    saved games:
        didn't think people would play for long stints
        introduced one-time saves
    high scores
    online replay of high scores (!)
    single player:
        tried doing a singleplayer bot
    the mysterious keys for the final station were a big hit and draw for having a goal
    for UI:
        got more and more complex
        implemented their own style sheet
    used MonoGame (not Unity)
    console porting:
        C#->IL->C++->platform toolchains
        did switch port themselves
            the most technically difficult b/c of memory issues and other
        handed of the other ports to special companies
    exhibitions: 15 (incl GDC, Pax )
        7 by publisher alone
        made merch and cut out paper stuff
    did some dev log filming for the publisher, but thought they were too cringy
    favoreable review by Concerned Ape on steam
    if u could do it over:
        use unity
            monogame -> c++ tool chain didn't work well
        target certain partners earlier
        start w/ online from day 1
    cross play:
        tedious certification agreements w/ console manufacturers

    Daryl big take aways:
        prototype scene in blender

FTL post mortem:
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4Um97AUqp4

    high premium on everything on screen at once
    over and over kept simplifying
        e.g. instead of subgrid within room, just have one room
    their conclusions:
        one core experience guides the project
        nothing but main goal is set in stone
        iterate and follow the fun

"Stop Getting Lost: Make Cognitive Maps, Not Levels":
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1Tczf8vxCM
  :)
    Is a tool
    Is made
    Represents spaces or concepts
    Is relational
    Has edges/limits
  :(
    Is not the "truth
    Not always orthographie
    Not always "flat'
    Not always physical
    Prescriptive
  Things people use to build cognative maps:
    Paths
      linear space that directs movement and travel
      very dominant
      most temporal
      "dead reckoning", "path integration"
      relies on continuity, proprioception (body sensing itself)
      good at catching lost players
    Landmarks
      single, localized, memorable, point-reference
      best if they aren't radially symetric / are directional
    Districts
      zonal reference
      contains like-things
    Edges
      linear reference, but not a path
      control continuity
    Nodes
      point reference
      convergence of paths; hub
  Getting lost:
    misalignment between cognative map and surroundings
  section is emotion, plan is structure
  radar/gps/minimap/hud can lead to egocentric view
    decrease in route memory
    disengage from the environment
    exploring the map instead of the terrain
  egocentric vs allocentric
    "piecemeal" vs "big picture"
