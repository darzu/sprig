    grid of micro blogs entries

Micro entry:
    Scene
    Code @ version or hash
    Dependencies @ version or hash
    Should be easy to open sample for oneself
    optional YouTube video link
    optional written text
    tags

    maybe: "start from X (other project) and follow Y (YouTube link)"
        creates a DAG between projects
        can use a "create lesson plan" to come up with a traversal to a particular topic

    record and replay user inputs?
        resize canvas to 128x128 or something

    future:
        upgradable
        web IDE
        easy dependencies
    
    What do the URLs look like?
        static serve from github pages
        so a project is a self-contained folder
        so to create a project, take an entry point and tree shake off everything else

    Build step:
        From entry point .ts file
            which has a standard attachToCanvas() function
        traverse imports
        collect files to be coppied
        create a readme.md
        tree shake off unused .ts ?
        copy to blog/ folder


Tree shaking:
    to minimize size of examples

    start from the "exportExample" function
    collect all the references it depends on,
    recurse over those

    does this need annotations of which code has side-effects?

    also very useful for keeping out random notes and unrelated & unreviewed snippets of code

    highlight key lines, which are all those using the key definitions
