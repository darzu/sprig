APPEND ONLY. Just a stream of conciousness as the inspiration strikes.

Start docked and your goal is to reach the next dock along the river.
Oregon trail style, you can load out your ship at docks.
You can take a bigger gem which increases your payout but also the difficulty.
The river sometimes splits, with different challenges and rewards down different paths.
You can buy maps from docks that tell you splits, lengths, etc.
Sometimes you enter a large lake and you have to navigate edges to find tributaries.
River can get wider and narrower.
Maybe you are on the ocean somtimes and you need to sail w/ wind.
Maybe your bringing food and supplies to little towns.
You can hire AI crew.
Everyone needs to eat and drink?
You can lose supplies by getting damaged.
  Like the gem heart, supply boxes straddle multiple ship tiles and 
    all need to be broken before you loose them.
You can repair ship tiles.
Fire cannons and broadsides.
Steer to line up shots and follow the river.
Players wear hats depending on their job.
  Maybe done automatically based on station/turret.
The game lobby is just the ship at dock.

With more players, eventually just add another ship.
  Widen the river and add enemies to compensate.

Branches in the river are actually water falls.
  Makes it easier to have something floating above the waterfall to indicate.
  Makes it clear that it's one-way.
  Nice chance to reset.
  Obscures what is ahead.

Game modes: Arcade vs Journey
  Journey: persistent, traveling dock to dock, rpg progression, maybe story
  Arcade: one run, maybe rogue-lite, easier to just do w/ friends

Cannon ball effects (positive and negative):
  (assumes many enemies take several hits)
  Cannon balls bounce off boats in a random direction
  Cannon balls are discus that skips along the water N times
  Cannon balls home on enemies
  Cannon balls splinter into shrapnel on strike
  Cannon balls burst into flak after X time
  Cannon ball project speed increases, arc flatens
  Mortar: Cannon ball is has higher min and max pitch but shoots farther
  Cannon fire reload is shared amongst all cannons
  Cannon fire pushes the ship
  Cannon balls push enemy boats
  Cannon ball creates vortex that alters the current of the river
  Cannon fires N balls at once (shotgun)
  Cannon fires 3 balls in a row (burst fire)
  All cannon balls attach a grappling hook, pulling enemies towards u
  all powder, no ball: cannons don't fire balls, instead they shoot a short range ball of fire
  Torpedo: The cannon turret is replaced with a underwater parascope and you shoot torpedoes at the bottom of boats
  Cannon turret relocates to a random hard point after every attack
  The cannon turret can be picked up and fired from the hip
  Cannon balls follow an outward spiral trajectory around the ship
  Lifesteal: cannon balls ricochet wood splinters back from the enemy boat to heal you
  Cannon balls stick to enemy boats, weighing them down and sinking them
  Anchor: Cannon balls are extremely heavy, with almost no range, and are chained to your ship causing your ship to anchor turn; disintigrate after a while
  Cannons fire shark bait causing sharks to attack the target
  Cannon balls apply fire that does damage-over-time once enough fire builds up
  Cannons can fire players
  Cannons damage the ship when firing
  Cannons roll backward when firing and need to be pushed back into place
  Cannons continually spin in a circle and you must time your shot to choose the yaw
  lightning rod: Cannon balls float and after a few seconds a lighting bolt strikes them in the water
  Cannon balls attach and inflate as a baloon, lifting enemy boats into the air
  Glass cannon: each cannon can be fired only once
  Cannon can no longer fire and are replaced with a big spike that does damage to enemy ships you run into
  Cannons don't fire balls instead they fire a burst of air that deflects incoming cannon balls
  Kick forward: Cannon fire pulls the ship towards the direction of fire
  Oil fire: cannon balls apply fire to the water, damaging boats that come into it
  Tracer: cannon balls leave a visible trail in the air, making it easier to aim
  Broadside: a row of connected cannons all aim and fire together

Woah, so u know how i have this idea to have a slingshot on the boat that flings the player forward a bit?
What if, at the end of a biome, there is a giant boat-flinging flingshot that launches the whole boat!
And get this, it flings it toward a new planet!
Like there were planets in the sky the whole time but u thought they were just part of the skybox, but actually they r the next biome!!

Came into posession of hyperspace ship
for reasons, need to sail from A to B across galaxy
u do this by traveling hyperspace network
when u go through a gate, can exit from 1-4 exits
  gates are probably in a solar system? or planets?
gameplay-wise: u enter in one place, u have some choices where to navigate to
  this navigation choice could be done in the overworld?
is it a stellaris graph?
  nice b/c it gives u series of transits
or is it stormlight-mental world? parallel reality?
gates on planets,
  u don't need to explain a ship being in space

Going Hyperpostal?
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Going_postal


Ship mega upgrades:
  - the front of the ship is a hinge and both sides swing forward to present one fat broadside
  - the ship submarines or flips over in water to sneak up between two ships to give a double broadside
  - fly down through a planet core Starwars ep1 style
  - fly through the mouth of a giant monster
  - cannons become attached to big gyroscope style swivels for all directions combat
      - lesser: rings (ring normal along ship dir)
  - cannon ball spawns portal on enemy ship
  - enemy ships scale up into M x N matrix of cannons facing you
    - u shoot individual cannon spots, maybe u can collapse an entire row
    - peglin cannon balls bounce between enemy cannons
    - bullet hell dodging

Ship travels through hyperspace:
  - Explict gates
  - license to make it spook and have some abstract concepts and madness
  - anything goes
  - can zoom through nebulas!!!

World building:
  
Tasks:
  Resource gathering
    Meta progression
      unrailed had the key
    Deep rock as main mission
    necessary to unlock the gate
  Hell divers, go herer do that defend
  goal: make the pathing more interesting than A to B
  Don't want to do binary must-clear-level like Hades
    hyperspace has to feel dangerous; you can't go toe to toe with everything
  Unrailed let you stockpile resources to aid ur next run

how do we avoid yelling at team mates like LoL?
  maybe slower pace of game?
  reduce the amount of info you have about each other's tasks
  reduce the skill ceiling

Roasting vs yelling
  worst: LoL players yelling at each other
  less good: overcooked
  okay: Valheim trench, secret castle, tree chopping, chest management?
  ???: unrailed bumping into each other?

World building:
  three stars, in a triangle, hopefully equalateral ish

Every game has at its heart (at least) one minigame.
In every FPS, it's clicking on targets + 3d positioning
In every racing game, it's steering along a curvy path
In every platforming game, it's the jumping arcs + timing button presses
In Pegglin, it's the prediction of the ball's path

Most games have 1-3ish of these plus layers of choices and variables to add depth.

Spacial Delivery could have way more of these! Aiming, steering, tetris-puzzler, overcooked, platformer, map pathfinding, flappy bird, and more. Each station or meta-station task could involve one or more of these.

Here's an idea for a taxonomy: 
"things that need to get done for the function of the ship" are "jobs",
and "self contained gameplay loops that further a job" are "mini games",
and "spots on the boat that do a thing" are stations.

Each station probably only works towards one job.
But perhaps there are many variations of station that can all fullfill the same job!
E.g. maybe repairing the ship can be done with a station where you play a tetris-like "minigame" to repair the ship,
or there is another station where you orbit the boat with a turret that shoots planks into places that need it,
or you hop out of the boat and platform around to do repairs.

This is one of the best ways Spacial Delivery could be very inclusive to different gaming styles! Cam might love playing an overcooked-ish minigame between a couple stations to fullfil repair or loading or resource gathering, while someone else might choose to use a turret-ish minigame to do similar tasks.

Further, this might be a good way to think about single player / fewer players. Maybe when there are less players, you have more stations that can do multiple jobs. Maybe access to some stations are gated on having greater than or less than a certain number of players.

maybe some minigames/stations are playable on mobile. A player could join on mobile primarily located at one station the whole time with maybe some simple auto pathing to get between stations.

Just like Outer Worlds made a solar system feel tangible, traversable, and "small",
Perhaps our game can make a galaxy feel tangible, traversable, and "small"
In hyperspace, star clusters, nebula, black holes, can all feel like reachable, interactive elements

How to get to hyperspace:
trebuchet from planet surface launches you in orbit, you go ~half orbit, 
then star lines stretch starwars style, you land with a splash onto the hyper
 plane, planet is behind you in small

At one point while playing Dyson Sphere I told Sami that the cubes 
  were carrying "science". And she was like "woah that's so cool! are 
  there any other abstract concepts as resources?" And I had to be like
  "no", and she was a lot less interested.
  There's definitely something catchy and fun about having concepts-as-things
  like "hours" and just the whole flavor of Sunless Skies.

narration flavor:
"
This is the realm of the gods and we do not belong.
It is not that they punish us for trespassing, it is that we don't even understand the rules of the board that is playing out.
We've stumbled into this land without comprehending what it is we do and you would be wise to get in, get your Continuum and get out.
And you have to hope that when you get out your loved ones aren't thousands
of years dead, or that you aren't stuck adrift in the infinite void between
flecks of matter.
"

environment ideas:
  as you move on the 2d surface, stars scroll past disproportionatly fast.
    the effect is like wind when you're moving quickly,
    also reminiscent of hyperspace like starwars

MVP experience:
  point to point navigation
  some impassible terrain
  enemy boats:
    random patrols
    enter area, spawn and come at you
  mining:
    EV? Not?

Gameplay hackathon ideas:
  - firing cannon at enemy ship
  - any resource collection
  - Grass cutting
  - sailing: controlling sail unfurl; sail direction
  - repairing
  - Hard points / ship customization
  - Multi-surface gameplay (UV surface traversal works on many shapes)
  - Portals
  - "Jumping" from one part of a surface to another, as a shortcut via 3D movement
  - snake monster
  - underwater anything
  - boarding enemy
  - multi-deck ship
  - crow's nest
  - impassible rocks
  - raising and lowering obstacles like turtle islands in Valheim
  - grapple hook floating objects

Okay okay I know this is probably bad idea, and yes I've been playing to much Factorio, but hear me out:

Say at the start of your journey, you get to choose to either:
- bring planks and nails
or
- bring logs, ingots, a mill, forge and anvil
the idea is that you can either bring specialized goods or base materials and crafting stations to use those goods.
With specialized goods it's obviously less work to use them in repair or other tasks but the risk is that you will run out of the right materials.
Whereas with generalized goods you have a lot more flexibility but it's a trade off in craft station space, complexity, and time.

This is actually how ship journeys used to work to a degree! They would stock extra sail cloth, huge lengths of rope, planks, and nails and then sew and work them to the sizes needed at sea.

Maybe after every combat, you have to go asses the damage to your ship and come up with a parts list. Then you need to source all those parts in order to do a repair. While your ship isn't repaired, you have a magic shield that is protected you but the bigger the breach the faster it drains your energy reserves. You need to get those wizard-wood planks in place to stabalize the energy leaks into the hyperspace ocean.

It’s also another mechanism to make combat dangerous: u might need a huge, costly repair afterwards
Also there’s a hand tools vs powertools tradeoff: power tools are faster, more expensive, take more space, take power to operate

If we’re low-poly enough, u could render the exact output on the ship. The process wouldn’t be perfect and u would see individual marks from the process. The ship would really feel like ur personal creation

Enemy ship movement:
  on 2d plane,
  for combat:
    goal location is a few ship lengths away off port or starboard
    or instead of a location, it's a path: circle around the player
    hardest mode would be: 
      right at edge of cannon range, if outside player range
      else if not outside player range and superior fire power, get in close
    funnest mode?
      always coming within player cannon range,
      ideally player gets first shot
      but it doesn't look unnatural
  when fleeing
    always pick a direction that is slightly less wind-favorable so that the player can catch up if they choose to. Enemies being able to escape is very frusterating.
  one idea is enemy ships could all be oar driven
    that way they can go anywhere at predictable speed
    and the player has a huge speed and maneuverability advantage if they play their cards right
  the simplest enemy sailing:
    For each sail, for each darkstar that matches, there's an easy ~270 degrees of movement options
    So when the enemy has a destination, they simply point towards it and independently adjust each sail to help (or fold it if it doesn't help)
    If they point at a destination where there's no current sail configuration that will get them there, they simply wait.
  slightly more complex:
    for enemy ship with a destination,
    sample possible directions (say 360 of them), for each sample:
      calculate max possible acceleration for each sail for each darkstar,
      then pick the sample direciton that in 1 unit of time minimizes the distance between current location and destination location.
        This should naturally create tacking I think?
      Discard possible directions that lead to collision within ~30 seconds.

Wood plank system:
  Ships and other structures are made of wood boards
    a board is a segmented cuboid: a 1d path of nodes where at each node there is an oriented quad
  keel, outside planks, floor planks, ribs, railing/trim, "features" (e.g. teeth)
  sheets?
    could be one big board; or seemlessly joined multiple boards
  modes: authoring, editting, coloring, destroying, repair
  use cases:
    sailing ship, house, table, chair, dock, 
  dependencies:
    boards depend on other boards at designated intersections
  destruction:
    volume based?: ideally a cannon ball that hits a ship would destroy a certain volume of wood, somewhat consistent with the damage capacity of that ball
    structure based: destorying elements like ribs would collapse dependents
      when a board has no path to the keel, it falls off?
  coloring:
    seperate from the path used to control the shape,
    have intervals along each board path; these can be colored independently
  data:
    board: path of points in 3d space (or polar or something else?)
    joints: connection points between boards
    object: set of boards, joints, intervals and mirroring options
    structure graph: board path + joints
  ops:
    findBoardsInMesh
    createMeshFromPath
    createPathFromMesh
    modifyMeshTriIndicesToRemoveSegment/splitBoard
    createThreeBoardParticlesForSegment
    sphereHitToPathIntervals
