All learning techniques have a floor and a ceiling:
  floor is entry requirements to using it effectively
  ceiling is how much you can get out of it
  LLMs & tutors probably have the lowest floor in many cases b/c u can ask basic clarifying questions a guide might not answer
  ideas to "lower the floor" of an article:
    add a "confusion highlighter", people can highlight areas they find confusing
    comments Q/A section w/ good ranking
    add a background/assumptions section w/ pointers
